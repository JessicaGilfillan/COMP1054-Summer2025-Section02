/* Styling Tables */
/* Look at Default Styles - default styles for tables are not pretty */

/* Spacing & Layout */



/* 

- a table-layout value of fixed is generally a good idea to set on your table as it makes the table behave more predictably by default 
- normally table columns tend to be sized according to how much content they contain - produces some strange results 
- table layout fixed allowes you to size columsn accordin to the width of their headings 
- set the headings to percetnage widths - the entire column follows the width of it's own heading 
- width 100% - it will fill any container that it is placed in
-border-collapse - standard best practice for any table styling effort 
-add padding to the th and td elements to give some space to the data items, more legible
